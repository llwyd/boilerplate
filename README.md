# C Boilerplate

[![Unit Test CI](https://github.com/llwyd/boilerplate/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/llwyd/boilerplate/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml)

Personalised boilerplate code so that I don't have to rewrite it for every project.

## Summary

- state.c
    - This is my personalised take on the UML state machine design pattern popularised by Miro Samek's writings about state machines (which are fantastic).
- fifo_base.c
    -  FIFO 'base class' with functionality for enqueuing, dequeuing, peeking etc for any particular type.
