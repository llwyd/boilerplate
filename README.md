# Boilerplate

Various boilerplate code I've made for use in projects.

## Summary

- state.c
    - This is my personal take on that UML state machine design pattern that I use in my various hobby projects. This is generally inspired by Miro Samek's design pattern and writings about state machines which I think are fantastic.
- fifo_base.c
    -  FIFO 'base class' with functionality for enqueuing, dequeuing etc for any particular type.
